                <p> Did you know that taking pictures can be super fun and full of surprises? Photography is like a magical playground where we can explore all sorts of cool ways to capture images! Let's dive into the exciting world of alternative processes in photography and get ready for some mind-blowing adventures!</p>
                <p> Picture this: a camera made out of a shoebox! That's right, we can turn a simple shoebox into a super-duper pinhole camera. It's like having our own secret spy gadget! We poke a tiny hole in one side of the box, put some special paper inside, and voila! When the sun peeks through the hole, it paints an incredible picture on the paper. It's like the sun is our very own artsy friend!</p>
                <h3>More Ideas!</h3>
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add two (2) additional paragrahs of text and another level 3 heading. -->
                <p>Now, get ready to put on your lab coat because we're about to become photography scientists! With the power of the sun and some magical chemicals, we can do something called cyanotype. It's like mixing potions, but way cooler! We paint a special mixture on paper, let it dry in the sunshine, and then place objects on top. When we expose it to sunlight, the paper changes colors! It's like having a personal rainbow-making machine! </p>
                <p>Time for a trip back in time! Ever seen those fancy old-timey photos that look like they've been around for centuries? Well, we can make our own with sepia toning! We take a regular black and white photo and dip it into a top-secret liquid (okay, it's not really top-secret, it's just a special solution). After a magical dip and a little drying time, our picture turns into a vintage treasure! We'll be the envy of all the time travelers! </p>
                <h3>Almost done!</h3>            
                    
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                <p> But wait, there's more! In this awesome world of alternative processes, we can do even more amazing things. Ever heard of photograms? It's like playing with shadows and shapes. We place objects directly onto special paper, expose them to light, and watch as they create mysterious silhouettes. And don't forget about instant film! It's like having a magical photo fairy that instantly prints our pictures. We'll be the fastest photographers in town!</p>
                <p>Now, let's imagine being detectives on a mysterious mission! In photography, there's a process called photomontage. It's like a puzzle where we can mix and match different pictures to create a whole new world! We can take a picture of ourselves, cut it out, and glue it onto a picture of a rocket ship. Zoom! We're now astronauts exploring outer space! With photomontage, we can be anything we want to be and tell incredible stories through our pictures. Get ready to unleash your imagination and embark on thrilling adventures! </p>
                <p>So, get ready for an incredible journey through the whimsical wonders of alternative processes in photography. Remember, there are no limits to our creativity and imagination. With a camera, a pinch of curiosity, and a whole lot of fun, we'll capture memories like never before. Let's go out there and snap some extraordinary moments! Say cheese, everyone! </p>

                    <h4>The distance of blue</h4>
                    <img src="images/routine.jpg" alt="i dont want to do this :(">
                    <p>Let's dive into the fascinating world of photography chemistry! Did you know that the color blue can magically disappear the farther away it gets? It's like a disappearing act for colors! When we look at objects in the distance, the air between us and the object scatters light, making it seem less blue. So, if you're ever wondering why faraway mountains look bluish, it's because the color blue loves to play hide-and-seek!<a class="expand" href="#">&#x26AB; &#x26AB; &#x26AB;</a></p>
                    
                    <h4>The developer smell</h4>
                    <img src="images/stag.jpg" alt="i dont want to do this :(">
                    <p>Now, let's talk about the secret superhero of photography: the developer! When we take a picture, the developer swoops in to bring the image to life. It's like a magical potion that reveals the hidden world captured by our camera. The developer works its magic by turning the exposed silver halide crystals on the film into black metallic silver. With each dip into the developer, our pictures come alive with detail and clarity. So, next time you see a photo magically appear before your eyes, thank the incredible powers of the developer!<a class="expand" href="#">&#x26AB; &#x26AB; &#x26AB;</a></p>
                    
                    <h4>OMG fixer stains!!!!</h4>
                    <img src="images/routine.jpg" alt="i dont want to do this :(">
                    <p>Uh-oh! Sometimes, even superheroes can leave their mark. In photography, we have a villain called the fixer stain. You see, after developing our photos, we need to use a special solution called the fixer to remove any unexposed silver halide crystals from the film. But if we're not careful, the fixer can leave behind some pesky stains on our pictures. These stains can appear as dark spots or marks that distract from the beauty of our images. But don't worry, there are ways to prevent and remove fixer stains, and with a little patience and practice, we can keep our photos clean and pristine!<a class="expand" href="#">&#x26AB; &#x26AB; &#x26AB;</a></p>
